      <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Rashed N. Al Jayousi—split between Jerusalem 🇵🇸 and Sendai 🇯🇵.  
        By day, I’m an assistant professor and JSPS postdoctoral  
        researcher in management and economics, fascinated by how NGOs  
        survive in conflict zones. But outside the academic lens I’m a  
        sketcher, cook, and calligraphy enthusiast who loves lo‑fi beats  
        while experimenting with Japanese sumi‑e and traditional  
        Palestinian patterns.

        <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Rashed Al Jayousi is a Palestinian from East Jerusalem. He’s currently
          a JSPS Postdoctoral Researcher at Tohoku University (2025–2027) and
          lectures at the Arab American University in Palestine. He served as
          a TA at Tohoku University and as a junior project officer at DCAF,
          leading projects on security‑sector governance, anti‑corruption,
          and legal reform across the West Bank and Gaza.
        </p>
        <p>
          Educated at Friends School (IB Diploma), he earned a BA in Economics
          (Minor in International Law &amp; Human Rights) at Al‑Quds Bard
          College/Al‑Quds University, then completed an MSc in Finance &
          Economic Development at the University of Glasgow on a HESPAL
          scholarship (2018). After working with DCAF (2018–20), he pursued
          a PhD in Management at Tohoku University (2021–24), researching
          institutionalization and knowledge‑sharing in conflict‑affected
          civil society. He then joined AAUP as Assistant Professor before
          starting his JSPS Fellowship in Sendai.
        </p>

          Outside academia, Rashed has lived and studied in five countries,
          presented at conferences across Europe and Asia, speaks five
          languages, and loves exploring cultures through travel.
